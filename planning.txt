do I want to use pyfiglet for the number display?






Option 2: Use a function and update() (like the second example)

Make a function that generates/returns your timer display
Call live.update(your_function()) each iteration
This regenerates the whole display each time

For your Pomodoro timer, Option 2 probably makes more sense because you're generating new text each second anyway (the time changes). You'd make a function that takes the current time and returns the formatted display, then call live.update() with it.
The pattern would be:

with Live(initial_display) as live:
Inside your while loop: live.update(new_display)
